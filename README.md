# Words & Numbers Game

A really simple little web app to let kids run through preset tests where the game player
needs is given a series of questions or challenges and needs to type out an answer.

If the player is linked to a school/club then you and their teacher would be able to gauge
their abilities as compared to their peers. 

A useful tool that is both fun and insightful for educators and parents alike.
